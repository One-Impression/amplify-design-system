# Claude Code Instructions — amplify-design-system

## What This Repo Is

This is the **build system** for One Impression's unified design tokens and shared UI components. It produces npm packages consumed by 3 products (Brand, Creator, Atmosphere).

## What This Repo Is NOT

This repo does NOT handle design governance, auditing, or intelligence. That is **Pixel Agent** (`pixel-agent` repo, public face at `canvas.amplify.club`). Pixel governs via PR-driven proposals back to this repo; this repo remains the upstream source of truth for component code and the publish target for Canvas packages. (Memory: feedback_canvas_distribution_via_npm.md.)

Before building anything related to:
- Token drift detection → already in Pixel (`token-sync.ts`)
- Design review / PR compliance → already in Pixel (`pr-reviewer.ts`)
- Accessibility auditing → already in Pixel (`accessibility-auditor.ts`)
- Theme management → already in Pixel (`theme-manager.ts`)
- Brand cascade → already in Pixel (`brand-cascade.ts`)
- Design mockups → already in Pixel (`design-generator.ts`)
- Component registry/tracking → already in Pixel (`design-system-manager.ts`)
- Visual regression → already in Pixel (`visual-comparison.ts`)
- Cross-product dependency analysis → already in Pixel (`cross-product-deps.ts`)
- Design governance / approval workflows → already in Pixel (`design-governance.ts`)
- Motion design system → already in Pixel (`motion-system.ts`)

**Check Pixel first. Do not duplicate.**

## Pixel ↔ This Repo Integration

Pixel reads from this repo via GitHub API:
- `packages/tokens-foundation/tokens/primitives/*.json` — primitive values
- `packages/tokens-foundation/tokens/semantic/*.json` — semantic mappings (light/dark)
- `packages/tokens-brand/tokens/*.json` — brand product theme tokens
- `packages/tokens-atmosphere/tokens/*.json` — atmosphere product theme tokens
- `packages/tokens-creator/tokens/*.json` — creator product theme tokens

Pixel's `token-sync.ts` compares these canonical files against what's deployed in product repos. When drift is found, Pixel raises alerts and can auto-cascade fixes.

## Build Commands

```bash
npm install          # Install workspace dependencies
npm run build        # Build all packages (tokens + UI + storybook)
npm run validate     # Cross-package consistency check
npm run storybook    # Launch Storybook at port 6006
```

## Package Structure

```
packages/
  tokens-foundation/  — Shared primitives (spacing, radii, shadows, typography, z-index, breakpoints)
  tokens-brand/       — Brand Platform tokens (purple primary, light/dark themes)
  tokens-atmosphere/  — Atmosphere tokens (gold accent, dark-first themes)
  tokens-creator/     — Creator App tokens (SDUI mappings, mobile-optimized)
  ui/                 — Shared React components (Button, Badge, Card, EmptyState, Skeleton)
  storybook/          — Component documentation and visual testing
  eslint-config/      — Design system lint rules (no-hardcoded-colors, no-raw-spacing, prefer-token-import)
  feature-flags/      — Feature flag utilities
```

## Token File Format

W3C Design Token Community Group (DTCG) format:
```json
{ "$value": "#6531FF", "$type": "color", "$description": "Primary accent" }
```

References use `{group.token}` syntax: `{ "$value": "{color.violet.600}" }`

Token hierarchy: primitives (raw values) → semantic (light/dark mappings) → product themes (product-specific overrides).

Build script (`scripts/build-tokens.js`) generates CSS variables, SCSS, JSON, JS, Tailwind v4, and React Native outputs.

## CI/CD

- `ci.yml` — Build all packages, validate consistency, secret scan, SDUI sync check
- `chromatic.yml` — Visual regression testing via Chromatic
- `storybook-deploy.yml` — Deploy Storybook to GitHub Pages on push to main
- ~~`figma-sync.yml`~~ — REMOVED: Tokens Studio integration deprecated in favour of direct PRs + Pixel cascade. Design changes flow via Pixel Agent governance, not Figma plugin.



## SDUI Form + Input Wiring

## SDUI Form + Input Wiring

The `Form` and `Input` snippets in `packages/sdui-runtime` are wired together through `FormContext` so that `bff_call` submit actions receive the latest user-entered values.

**Key files:**
- `src/snippets/Form/form-values.ts` — framework-free `mergeFormValuesIntoAction`, `createFormState`, `FormState` interface
- `src/snippets/Form/Form.renderer.tsx` — `FormContext` (ref-backed), `FormSubmitWrapper`
- `src/ui_components/Input/Input.renderer.tsx` — `InputInner` with local `useState` + `FormContext` propagation

**`field_name` extension field**: `Input` reads `data.field_name` off the raw node *before* schema validation (the strict zod schema strips unknown keys). When set, each keystroke calls `formCtx.setValue(field_name, value)`. When absent, the Input behaves as a stand-alone controlled input — nothing writes to `FormContext`.

**Submit flow**: `FormSubmitWrapper` wraps the submit button, strips its own `on_click`, and at click time calls `mergeFormValuesIntoAction(onClick, getValues())`. For `bff_call` actions this merges the ref-backed values snapshot into `payload.request_body` (form values overlay existing keys). Non-`bff_call` actions pass through unchanged.

**Ref-backed state**: `FormContext` stores values in a `useRef` — not `useState` — so keystrokes do not re-render the whole Form. `InputInner` manages its own `useState` for cursor stability, and seeds `FormContext` with the server-provided `data.value` on mount via a ref-captured `useEffect` (empty deps, no lint suppression needed).

**Unit tests**: `src/snippets/Form/__tests__/form-values.test.ts` covers the full contract (setValue/getValues propagation, merge logic, overlay behaviour, pass-through for non-bff_call) without a React Native runtime.

## Rules

1. **No hardcoded colors** in UI components — use CSS variables only
2. **No design governance logic here** — that's Pixel's job
3. **All token changes** go through direct PR (Pixel will detect drift and auto-cascade)
4. **ESLint rules** exist in `packages/eslint-config/rules/` but are NOT enforced in product repos yet
5. **Breaking changes** to CSS variable names or values require a migration note in the PR description

## Oportunities theme (newest product line)

Oportunities is the newest product theme in this monorepo. It ships as the
Studio-direction brand for One Impression's creator-intent platform.

- **Tokens**: `packages/tokens-oportunities/` — apricot palette, Geist + Inter + JBM, light + dark
- **Brand assets**: `packages/brand-oportunities/` — logos, app icons, favicons, social templates, business cards, email signature
- **Brand decisions**: `packages/brand-oportunities/BRAND-DECISIONS.md` — founder-approved, do not change without sign-off
- **Engineer hand-off**: `packages/brand-oportunities/ENGINEER-HANDOFF.md` — how to consume in a product app
- **Components**: 6 new composed components in `@one-impression/ui` (`Wordmark`, `SignalDot`, `CreatorIntentCard`, `BrandInterestCard`, `IntentFeed`, `AppIconOportunities`)

**Composition rule**: Oportunities components compose from `tokens-foundation`
primitives + existing `@one-impression/ui` primitives (Card, Avatar, Badge, etc.).
**Never invent new primitives for Oportunities** — add a composed component
that wraps existing primitives instead. If a true primitive is missing, raise
it in `@one-impression/ui` first so all themes benefit.

**Spelling**: single-P "Oportunities" everywhere. Not "Opportunities".
